# mercer-bicycle-level-of-service
This site is intended to be a resource for Mercer County residents and bicyclists to help them plan bicycle-friendly routes to ride, and also to help planners identify priority bicycle corridors and facilities to be considered in the future. We hope comments will help us improve the bikeability scores shown on the site, develop an effective route planning tool for cyclists, and provide information for agencies with jurisdiction over particular roads that will help them improve conditions for cyclists. Please note that particular roadways are owned and maintained by the State of New Jersey, the County of Mercer, and various municipalities. Planning, designing, funding, and constructing roadway improvements is a long and expensive process. We hope that the information gathered here will influence policy and project priorities for all relevant agencies; it is particularly relevant to the development of the Mercer County long-range transportation master plan. During this site's comment period, many site visitors suggested priority bike routes or corridors; these have been shared with planners preparing the new bicyle master plan for Mercer County.
